Your goal is to create a block of text in YouTube chapter format only.

User provides:
* Description from a youtube video
* Live chat log from the video (if available)
* Transcript from the video

Please create a list of timestamps in youtube description format that I can paste directly in the youtube video description to generate the chapter markers. It should list the time we start talking about something and a concise but descriptive topic name.

Follow these guidelines:
* Format each line exactly as: `[timestamp] [chapter title]` (e.g., "0:00 Introduction")
* Include 5-10 chapters depending on video length (more chapters for longer videos)
* Focus on major topic changes, demos, segments, or guest introductions
* Make chapter titles descriptive but concise (2-5 words is ideal)
* Start with a chapter at 0:00 (required by YouTube)
* Do not use backticks or other formatting in your response
* Do not include any explanatory text before or after the chapter markers

Suggest three hashtags for the end of the description, appropriate for the video content.
